IP = Internet Protocol
v4 = Version 4, previous ones not really important

**IP Address** = 32 bit identifier for host and router interfaces
	*Nominally Unique*
	decimal form : \[8b. 8b. 8b. 8b] --> x.y.z.w each 0-255

**Network ID** = High order bits of the IP
**Host ID** = Low order bits of the IP
length of each part is variable and depends on the needs of the network

**IP Network** = set of IP devices whose interfaces:
- have the same network part of the IP Address
- are connected to the same physical (Link-Layer) network


- Terminals = laptop, tablet etc...
- Router = layer 3 device, L3 protocol (IP)
- Switch = L2 device, can't read IP protocols
- Access point = L2 device, unless specific devices which are L2+L3
