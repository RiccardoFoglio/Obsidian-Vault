Preprocessing
	Data Cleaning -> reduces noise effect, removes outliers, solves inconsistencies
	Data Integration -> reconciles data extracted, integrates metadata, solves conflicts, manages redundancy

Association Rules
- analyze correlations or patterns from transactional database

- Regression -> prediction of a continuous value
- Outlier Detection
