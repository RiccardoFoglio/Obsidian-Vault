it's about defining the product properties before starting the development.
Without this step, product properties are unclear and testing is not feasible.

Properties:
- Functional : what the program should do
- Non-Functional : modalities applied to functions offered
	- Reliability
	- Usability
	- Performance
	- Maintainability
	- Security

The final product may, or may not, have properties that match the requirements
Requirements are requests, that may or may not become properties of the product

Requirements should be both complete and consistent:
- Complete --> should include descriptions of all features required
- Consistent --> there should be no conflicts or contradictions in the descriptions of the system features

Defects:
- omissions / incompleteness
- incorrect fact
- inconsistency / contradiction
- ambiguity
- extraneous information
- redundancy

Techniques:
- stakeholders : ask informal description of product. List relevant stakeholders is essential to consider relevant POVs for an application 
- business model : involves some set requirements on payments for example
- personas, stories
- context diagram and interfaces
- requirements, F, NF
- Table of rights
- scenarios, sequence diagrams
- use cases
- glossary
- system design
