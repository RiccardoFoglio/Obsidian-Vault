Devices: Interactive Systems + User Interfaces
Performance, Errors: Ergonomics, Human Factors

Man-Machine Interaction (MMI) --> problem: also women 
Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) --> includes also non computers
Human-Computer Interaction

User-centered design: methodology to design 

HCI is a multi-disciplinary field of study. Concerned with design evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and study of major phenomena surrounding them
Involves Humans and Computers, they determine the behavior over time of each other.
- Humans' goals and related tasks/pursuits

Multidisciplinary:
- **Psychology**: user perceptual, cognitive and problem-solving skills
- **Ergonomics**: User's physical capabilities
- **Sociology**: Understanding the wider context of the interaction
- **Computer Science and Computer Engineering**: building necessary artifacts (HW, SW)
- **Business**: Satisfying market needs
- **Graphic Design**: Produce an effective interface presentation
- **Technical Writing**: documentation, manuals, on-screen content

Other fields help us in:
- Design methods and processes
- Models
- Heuristics
- Best Practices
- Conventions
- Experiments and user studies

Goal of HCI
- User
- Computer
- Task(s) to be accomplished

--> system must support the user's task with a focus on usability (Useful, Usable and Used)

Human:
- Sensory System (Visual, Auditory, Haptic, Spatial)
- Acting System (Hands, Voice, Head, Body)
- Cognitive Processes (perception, memory)

Computer:
- Input Peripherals (Keyboard, mouse, Trackpad, touch surface, microphone, sensors, card readers...)
- Output Peripherals (Screen, Audio, Haptics, VR/AR headset)

## Model of Interaction


Interaction is not the idea promoted and repeated that a computer and a human are engaged BUT
it concerns 2 entities (human and computers) that determine each other's behavior over time

Users with their goal in pursuit, are the ultimate metric of interaction

User wants to accomplish some goals in a specific application domain
Each domain has a specific jargon, set of possible processes and goals, artifacts etc..

Tasks are operations to manipulate the concepts of a domain
The goal is attained by performing one or more tasks

Interaction studies the relation between user and system
The system possesses a state and speaks a **core language**
The user possesses a state that includes an understanding of the system's state, some intention to perform a task and speaks the **task language**

Execution:
1. Establish the goal (WHAT)
2. Forming the intention (HOW)
3. Specifying the action sequence
4. Executing the action

Evaluation:
5. Perceiving the system state
6. Interpreting the system state
7. Evaluating the system state

Gulf of Execution/Evaluation is the phase in which you encounter problems
These gulfs cannot be removed, but a good systems has the smallest gulfs possible,
therefore all systems should be made as simple as possible (even though it could still be complex, but minimize as best as you can)

Human Errors : in the gulf of execution
- Slips = right action but failed to execute it, might be corrected with a better interface
- Mistakes = you don't know the system well enough to formulate the right goal, user mental model is not correct, requires more radical redesign

Human Errors are never faults of the user, rather a result of bad design
System design should minimize error and maximize results

Frameworks: Major UI Styles
- Command Line Interface
- Menus
- Natural Language
- Question/Answer and Query Dialog
- Form-FIlls and Spreadsheets
- Windows, Icons, Menus and Pointers (WIMP) (desktop environment)
- Mobile
- Point and Click
- 3D Interface

## Design Processes and Frameworks

User-Centered Design (UCD) --> avoids risk of software project failure by around 50%

Participatory Design --> users directly involved in collaborative design

Agile Interaction Design --> Agile dev in soft eng, evolutionary development in sprints

Design Thinking --> 5 stage non-linear interactive process
- Empathize: reserach user's needs
- Define: state found needs
- Ideate: challenge assumptions and ideate
- Prototype: create solutions
- Test: try the solutions

Service Design --> describe contemporary shift from products to services, focus on complete experience

## Human-Centered Design Process

Usability = extent to which a system product or service can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfactions in a context of use

Dimensions of usability:
- Usefullnes
- Learnability
- Memorability
- Effectiveness
- Efficiency
- Visibility
- Errors
- Satisfaction
