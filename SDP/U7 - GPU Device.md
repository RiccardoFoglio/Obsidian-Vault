# Parallel and Distributed Computing

Programming today a synonym of parallel programming
CPU has 6-8-12 cores, multithreading is growing on other devices
Fast network adapters are usual even in PCs motherboards

concurrency and parallelism are often intended with the same meaning, but don't identify the same thing

- Concurrency = manipulates many things at the same time.
	- multiple tasks are performed in overlapping time intervals without specific order
	- task execution seems contemporary but it's not
- Parallelism = Performs many things at the same time
	- multiple tasks are executed in the same time intervals in multi-processor or multi-core systems
	- obtained by transforming a sequential execution flow into a parallel one

efficiency depends on hardware structures and architectures, software parallelization, capability of compilers to generate efficient code

$$
P = C \cdot VË†{2}\cdot F
$$
C = capacity of transistors
V = supply voltage
F = clock frequency
