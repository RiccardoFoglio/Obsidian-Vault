In 2022 C++ was 3rd most used programming language in the world.
In 2024 C++ less used, overcome by java and javascript

C++ Strength: performance and low level control, adaptable (Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS...)

C++ has expanded over time and it now includes:
- Procedural --> program composed by procedures
- Imperative --> sequence of commands for the computer to execute
- Generic Programming --> algorithms are written in terms of programs to-be specified later
- Functional --> programs are constructed by composing functions
- Object-oriented --> programs are organized around data (or objects)
- Low-level Construct --> Programs allow low-level manipulation

Portability is paramount in the world of software dev.
- the ability to write code once and have it run across diverse OS is a significant advantage

C++ strength shines:
- Often associated with performance and low-level control
- adaptability across Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS and more

C++ inherits most of C's syntax. almost always implemented as a compiled language.
C++ Project must be organized as:
- set of header files including the declarations --> \<name>.h 
- set of C++ files including the header files and implementation --> \<name>.cpp
- if a strict separation is maintained, it's possible to create a library
