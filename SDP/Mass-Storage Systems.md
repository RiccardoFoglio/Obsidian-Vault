# Overview of Mass Storage Structure

Bulk of secondary storage for modern computers is hard disk drives (HDDs) and nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices 
HDDs spin platters of magnetically-coated material under moving readwrite heads 

- Drives rotate at 60 to 250 times per second 
- Transfer rate is rate at which data flow between drive and computer
- Positioning time (random-access time) is time to move disk arm to desired cylinder (seek time) and time for desired sector to rotate under the disk head (rotational latency) 
- Head crash results from disk head making contact with the disk surface -- Thatâ€™s bad 

Disks can be removable
