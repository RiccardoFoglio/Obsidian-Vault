`paddr_t` = physical address, real RAM memory address
`vaddr_t` = virtual address, process that is used to access memory
process uses `vaddr_t`
OS knows that a `vaddr_t` corresponds to a specific `paddr_t` via a page table

# Overview

OS161 is a didactic OS that rungs on MIPS virtual machine.
- device driver
- scheduler
- threads inside kernel
- virtual memory
- file system
- trap and interrupt system

thread = control state of an executing program, has an associated context and memory
- user threads
- kernel threads 

Process = program in execution
- text section
- program counter
- stack
- data section
- heap

Thread Library = provides programmer with API for creating and managing threads
2 options
- library entirely in user space
- kernel-level library supported by OS

In OS161 thread control block is a thread structure

```c++
/* see kern/include/thread.h */ 
struct thread { 
	char *t_name;                  /* Name of this thread */ 
	const char *t_wchan_name;      /* Name of wait channel, if sleeping */ 
	threadstate_t t_state;         /* State this thread is in */ 
	/* Thread subsystem internal fields. */ 
	struct thread_machdep t_machdep; 
	struct threadlistnode t_listnode; 
	void *t_stack;                 /* Kernel-level stack */ 
	struct switchframe *t_context; /* Saved register context (on stack) */ 
	struct cpu *t_cpu;             /* CPU thread runs on */ 
	struct proc *t_proc;           /* Process thread belongs to */ 
	...
};
```
``` c++
struct proc {
	char *p_name;
	struct spinlock p_lock;
	unsigned p_numthreads;
	/* VM */
	struct addrspace *p_addrspace;
	/* VFS */
	struct vnode *p_cwd;
	/* add more as needed */
}
```

## OS Services
![[Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 10.12.07 PM.png]]
## System Calls
Programming interface to the services provided by the OS
Mostly accessed by programs via a high-level API rather than direct system call use
3 most common APIs: 
- Win32 API for Windows
- POSIX API for Posix
- Java API for Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

Number associated to each Sys call that is connected to a table
when interface called, returns status of the call and any return value
caller doesn't know how it's implemented, just receives result

Types of sys calls:
- process control
- file management
- device management
- information maintenance
- communication
- protection

ELF files contain address space segment descriptions, which are useful to the kernel when it's loading a new address space
ELF file identifies virtual address of program's first instruction
ELF file also contains lots of other info useful to compilers, linkers, debuggers and loaders
# Memory

contiguous allocation, allocating by page multiples (4096 byte frame), allocator is common to user memory and dynamic kernel memory

# Synchronization Primitives

Critical section = part of program that cannot be executed by more than one process/thread at a time
- process may be changing common variables, updating table, writing file...
- when one process in critical section, no other may be in the critical section

Solutions:
- Mutual exclusion : if process $P_{i}$ is executing in its critical section, no other process can be executing in their critical sections
- Progress : if no process is executing in its critical section and some wish to enter it, the selection of the processes that will enter cannot be postponed indefinitely
- Bounded waiting : bound must exist on the number of tines that processes are allowed to enter their critical sections after a process has made a request to enter its critical section and before that request is granted

2 approaches:
- preemptive: allows preemption of process when running in kernel mode
- non-preemptive: runs until exits kernel mode, blocks or voluntarily yields CPU (free of race condition in kernel mode)

Peter's solution = 2 process solution, load and store are atomic, processes share 2 variables: `int turn`, `boolean flag[2]`
- `turn` indicates whose turn it is to enter the critical section
- `flag` array used to indicate if a process is ready to enter the critical section
1. mutual exclusion is preserved
2. progress requirement is satisfied
3. bounded-waiting requirement is met

not guaranteed to work in modern architectures --> reordering of instructions may produce different results than expected
--> acquire lock, enter critical section, release lock, remainder of section

to implement locks: need hardware support
- uniprocessors -- could disable interrupts
- modern machines provide special atomic hardware instructions

many systems provide hardware support for implementing the critical section code
uniprocessors could disable interrupts
	currently running code would execute without preemption
	generally too inefficient on multiprocessor systems

Memory barriers: instruction that forces any change in memory to be propagated to all other processors

hardware instructions: *test-and-modify* the content of a word or *swap* the contents of two words atomically (uninterruptibly)
- Test-and-Set instruction
- Compare-and-Swap instruction


spinlock : good if delays are short, fast critical section
can be implemented in mny ways:
- test-and-set
- optimized (for performance) versions: test + test-and-set
	- loop on test
	- when free do test-and-set

Disabling interrupts: on a uniprocessor, only one thread at a time is actually running
if the running thread is executing a critical section, mutual exclusion may be violated if:
- running thread is preempted while its in the critical section and
- the scheduler chooses a different thread to run, and this new thread enters the same critical section that the preempted thread was in

# User Processes

loading a program into address space: kernel creates a process to run, must also create an address space for it and load the program's code and data inside
Data is inside an ELF file, contain address space segment descriptions, which are useful to the kernel when it's loading a new address space
each ELF segment describes a contiguous region of virtual address space
- virtual address of the start of the segment
- length of segment in virtual address space
- location of the start of the image in the ELF file
- length of the image in the ELF file

OS161 DUMBVM implementation assumes ELF file contain text and data segments

- .text: program code
- .rodata: read only global data
- .data: initialized global data
- .bss: uninitialized global data
- .sbss: small uninitialized global data

System Calls:
- programming interface for user programs to the services offered by the system
- user program view: an API
- kernel view: software interrupt

need to do `proc_destroy` after `thread_exit` detaches thread from proc
solutions:
- sleep and/or polling before calling `proc_destroy`
- detach thread before signal, modify `thread_exit` or `proc_remthread` (detach a thread only if still attached to proc)

Need array to support conversion from pid to pointer
# File System and IO

the file system implementation has 2 directories:
- virtual file system: kern/vfs/
- actual file system: kern/fs/
