Digital image = image f(x,y) discretized both in space and brightness
It's usually a matrix with up to several million values (Gigapixel cameras)

Computer Vision usually tries to emulate human vision in machines
	Image processing refers to manipulations of the images
	both are related to image analysis, image synthesis is instead related to virtual reality

Pixel or pel (picture element) = sample created by a detector (it can give an analog or digital output)
Datel (data element) = each datum is a datel, which is in the computer memory
	datels and pixels are the same if the detector is already in digital form, otherwise datels are given by the frame grabber's digitalization rate, which can produce more datels than pixels (but without more resolution)
	image processing algorithms work with datels
Disel (display element) = smallest element that a display medium can access
Resel (resolution element) = smallest signal supported by an analog system


jpeg = compatto perch√® non registra e perde alcuni dettagli

Computer Vision: several fields:
- industrial machine vision
- medicine
- astronomy
- remote sensoring
- infrared ultrasound x-ray and radar imaging
- partile physics
- computer games
