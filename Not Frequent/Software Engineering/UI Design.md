Usability (NF Requirement)

•When human actors are involved, designing the User Interface (often Graphical User Interface) is a key design choice
•We assume that RE activity has been completed
	•(in practice RE and UI design may overlap)


UI Should be experimented with the end users
A UI should not be explained, must be easy to use


Starting point: context diagram, actors + functional requirements + Use cases

UI changes the most because it keeps getting improved from user feedbacks

Simplicity: complexity of functions complexity of structure and complexity of usage

UI should be as simple as possible as allowed by the complexity of structure and functionality

Personas:
- identify and describe typical users
- persona = subset of actor
- describe life scenarios for each persona
- identify possible interaction with the application

Stories:
- help understand interactions
- cheap way to illustrate design solutions from user's POV
- tell user's goals motivations and actions
Without your solution: present-based --> focus is set on current practices that illustrate "state of the art" and problem context
with your solution: future-based --> focus on how problems could be addressed (without diving into details and jargon)

Approaches:
- Ergonomy: safety adaptability, comfort, usability
- Emotional design: interaction should cause positive emotions in the user
- User experience (UX) --> Usability + feelings + emotions + values
- transparent technology --> no emphasis on technology
- feedback, user centered design --> no decision based on personal opinions, but feedback from real users

Prototypes
- Low fidelity --> paper/ pencil, sketches...
  Feedback : cognitive, ergonomy experts apply checklists / experience to identify possible issues
- high fidelity --> computer executable mock ups, actual GUIs
  Feedback : selected users use the prototype in lab, give accurate feedbacks on specific issues

Ethnographics
- end users perform their usual activities, using prototype
- Researchers observe the behavior of end users and especially interactions with prototype
- researcher tries to be invisible to avoid interference with the user behavior

Interviews : end users use prototype, after use, subset of users is interviewed to know more
Focus Groups : users use prototype, after they gather in a meeting lead bu a moderator 

Feedback, final system
- Define and collect measures about: usage of system (time spent on different pages / part of pages, errors)
- Effect of system, conversion rate (ex rate from browse to purchase)

Conversion rate : in general from awareness of product to customers purchasing
On e-commerce website: from number of landing on web page per day to number of purchases

Portability of the GUI:
- redevelop GUI for each environment
- cross platform compilers
- cross platform GUI

Usability Guidelines:
- have same style and format in all pages
- don't ask for same info twice
- give feedback
- make interactive objects obvious
- consider default values in input fields
- clear success / error messages
- show clearly navigation hierarchy
- simplicity and readabiliy
- use conventions (logos on top left, logo brings to home etc...)

In mass market products user interaction is key
User centered design
	focuses on user feedback
	using several techniques in a defined process
Key message: UI design must be validated with users
