## Inception

1x1 convolutions --> acting as a network in network

can be used to reduce the number of filters (depth) without shrinking the size

let the network choose which convolutions are helpful, if you have enough computational power do all convolutions and let the network choose

this technique helps in preventing too many computations (cost: lose some info but benefits are greater)

calculate whatever and use what is needed
