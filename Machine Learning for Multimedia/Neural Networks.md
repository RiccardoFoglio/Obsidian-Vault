Algorithms that try to mimic the brain
very widely used in 80s and early 90s, then diminished
recent resurgence: state-of-the-art technique for many applications

very hard to find this hypothesis, and also have many features

when you want to recognize an image, you don't feed a single pixel but the whole image as pixel values, so a matrix of 3 layers (RGB) --> 64x64 images means 3 matrices of 4096 values = 12288 features

Brain has one algorithm to learn

our neuron:

artificial neuron model:

Sigmoid (logistic) also used as activation function a --> classification

Artificial Neural Network:

2 layer network because you don't count the input layer (Layer 0)
the intermediate layers are called Hidden Layers

we rename input layers from x to $aË†{[0]}$

Binary vs Multiclass

Often neural networks are black box models, because the hidden layers do a lot of the work but only the output is shown

Architecture : Shallow vs Deep: deep neural network = lots of layers 
it's chosen by the developer

Car recognition:

m = complete data set, lots of cars and lots of non car to train the network
we need labels (y)

weights and biases

we want to find w and b to minimize J(w,b) using gradient descent
