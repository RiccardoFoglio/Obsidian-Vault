- m = number of training examples (number of rows)
- x's = input variable / features
- y's = output variable / target
- (x,y) = one training example (one row)
- ($x^{(i)}$, $y^{(i)}$) = i-th training example (row i)

best way to define the function is to minimize the distance of the data and the predicted curve, by finding the position and orientation of the line

$h_\theta(x^{(i)})$ is the predicted value, $y^{(i)}$ is the actual
